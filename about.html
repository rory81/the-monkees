						About: The Monkees
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>In 1965, over 400 people responded to an ad seeking young men for a new television show about a rock group called The Monkees. The Monkees, starring Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork premiered on September 12, 1966, and audiences
							adored the humorous antics of the band. Though made for TV, The Monkees had real-life hits and struggled against their "Pre-Fab Four" image. Some of their best-loved and number one hits included Neil Diamond's "I'm a Believer" and "Last Train to
							Clarksville." More successful singles followed, including another Neil Diamond song, "Little Bit Me, Little Bit You," Gerry Goffin and Carole King's "Pleasant Valley Sunday", and "Daydream Believer" by John Stewart of the Kingston Trio. There was
							a renewed interest in the Monkees, however, in the 1980s, when some of the group's original recordings returned to the charts. In 1986, Dolenz, Tork and Jones reunited for a concert tour. That same year, they released a greatest hits collection,
							Then and Now, featuring a new track, "That Was Then, This Is Now." Reruns of the group's series began airing on MTV in 1987, giving the band even more of a boost. That same year, the Monkees released the album Pool It!. Nesmith returned to the
							group in the mid-1990s for a successful tour and a new album, 1996's Justus. While the new recording failed to make the charts, the Monkees' previous albums have remained strong sellers over the years. In 2003, The Best of the Monkees reached No.
							51 on the Billboard 200 chart.

						About: Davy Jones
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>Davy Jones became a popular teen idol in the late 1960s. He began an acting career at the age of 11, winning a role on the popular British soap opera Coronation Street. Jones trained to become a jockey for a time, but gave up that career path to
							perform on stage. He played the Artful Dodger in a London production of the musical Oliver!, reprising the role for his Broadway debut in 1963. He received a Tony Award nomination for his performance that same year. Jones landed a few television
							guest appearances and other roles before landing his big break: Along with Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork and Mickey Dolenz, he was selected to perform on a new TV series about a rock group modeled after the Beatles. The Monkees debuted in September
							1966, with audiences adoring the humorous antics of the manufactured band. Jones especially attracted attention from fans due to his charm and boyish good looks.</p>
						<p>Outside of his work with the Monkees, Jones continued to act. He had a cameo in The Brady Bunch Movie (1995) and appeared on such shows as Boy Meets World, The Single Guy and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. On the London stage, he appeared in Oliver!â€”this
							time playing Fagin. He also starred as Jesus in a revival of Godspell. Known for his wit and warm sense of humor, Jones wrote several autobiographies, including 1987's They Made a Monkee Out of Me. He also owned several thoroughbred race horses.
							Music, however, has remained his main passion. He has recorded several solo albums, including 2001's Just Me. In his later years, Jones spent much of the year on tour with his band. He released a collection of his most requested songs, entitled
							Incredible Revisited, in 2008. He also made numerous personal appearances to meet up with fans and participated in a number of sporting events for charity. Active until the end, Jones died on February 29, 2012, in Stuart, Florida, after suffering
							a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Jessica; four daughters from previous relationships, Annabel, Talia, Jessica and Sarah; and several grandchildren.</p>
