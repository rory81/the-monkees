						About: The Monkees
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>In 1965, over 400 people responded to an ad seeking young men for a new television show about a rock group called The Monkees. The Monkees, starring Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork premiered on September 12, 1966, and audiences
							adored the humorous antics of the band. Though made for TV, The Monkees had real-life hits and struggled against their "Pre-Fab Four" image. Some of their best-loved and number one hits included Neil Diamond's "I'm a Believer" and "Last Train to
							Clarksville." More successful singles followed, including another Neil Diamond song, "Little Bit Me, Little Bit You," Gerry Goffin and Carole King's "Pleasant Valley Sunday", and "Daydream Believer" by John Stewart of the Kingston Trio. There was
							a renewed interest in the Monkees, however, in the 1980s, when some of the group's original recordings returned to the charts. In 1986, Dolenz, Tork and Jones reunited for a concert tour. That same year, they released a greatest hits collection,
							Then and Now, featuring a new track, "That Was Then, This Is Now." Reruns of the group's series began airing on MTV in 1987, giving the band even more of a boost. That same year, the Monkees released the album Pool It!. Nesmith returned to the
							group in the mid-1990s for a successful tour and a new album, 1996's Justus. While the new recording failed to make the charts, the Monkees' previous albums have remained strong sellers over the years. In 2003, The Best of the Monkees reached No.
							51 on the Billboard 200 chart.

						About: Davy Jones

					</div>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>Davy Jones became a popular teen idol in the late 1960s. He began an acting career at the age of 11, winning a role on the popular British soap opera Coronation Street. Jones trained to become a jockey for a time, but gave up that career path to
							perform on stage. He played the Artful Dodger in a London production of the musical Oliver!, reprising the role for his Broadway debut in 1963. He received a Tony Award nomination for his performance that same year. Jones landed a few television
							guest appearances and other roles before landing his big break: Along with Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork and Mickey Dolenz, he was selected to perform on a new TV series about a rock group modeled after the Beatles. The Monkees debuted in September
							1966, with audiences adoring the humorous antics of the manufactured band. Jones especially attracted attention from fans due to his charm and boyish good looks.</p>
						<p>Outside of his work with the Monkees, Jones continued to act. He had a cameo in The Brady Bunch Movie (1995) and appeared on such shows as Boy Meets World, The Single Guy and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. On the London stage, he appeared in Oliver!â€”this
							time playing Fagin. He also starred as Jesus in a revival of Godspell. Known for his wit and warm sense of humor, Jones wrote several autobiographies, including 1987's They Made a Monkee Out of Me. He also owned several thoroughbred race horses.
							Music, however, has remained his main passion. He has recorded several solo albums, including 2001's Just Me. In his later years, Jones spent much of the year on tour with his band. He released a collection of his most requested songs, entitled
							Incredible Revisited, in 2008. He also made numerous personal appearances to meet up with fans and participated in a number of sporting events for charity. Active until the end, Jones died on February 29, 2012, in Stuart, Florida, after suffering
							a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Jessica; four daughters from previous relationships, Annabel, Talia, Jessica and Sarah; and several grandchildren.</p>

						About: Mickey Dolenz
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>George Michael Dolenz was born on March 8, 1945 in Los Angeles, CA to George and Janelle Dolenz, who were both involved in show business. Nicknamed "Micky," he has three sisters including Coco, who frequently performs with him at his current solo
							shows. At the age of 10, Micky played the part of Corky in the NBC sitcom "Circus Boy" under the last name "Braddock." From 1956-1958 the show aired and Micky toured the country with the show's star elephant, Bimbo. After "Circus Boy" went off
							the air, Micky's parents took him out of show business and brought him back to a normal child's life. Dolenz often says that this was the "smartest thing they ever did." As he got older, Micky played with many nightclub bands including Micky and
							the One Nighters, where he played rhythm guitar and lead vocals. During this time period, Micky recorded his first single, "Huff Puff"/"Don't Do It." As it turned out, the single never saw the light of day until 1967, when "Don't Do It" reached
							No. 75 on the Billboard charts.</p>
						<p>In the fall of 1965, Micky was a college student studying Architecture when he auditioned for a part in "The Monkees." Just weeks later, he was chosen to become a member of the TV and music phenomenon. During this time, Micky got his first directing
							job on "The Monkees" TV show's "Frodis Caper" episode. By late-1970, the other Monkees had given up and Micky was left to pursue a solo career.</p>
						<p>The early-70s brought Micky directing TV commercials and several NASA spots, as well as lending his voice to various animated productions, such as "The Funky Fantom" and "The Scooby-Doo Movies." He also kept his music career rolling by releasing
							some solo singles, like "A Lover's Prayer" and "To Be or Not To Be," but never any albums. In 1975, Dolenz joined forces with fellow Monkee, Davy Jones and Monkees songwriters, Tommy Boyce & Bobby Hart. This semi-Monkees reunion lasted until 1977,
							when he and Jones traveled to England to star in Harry Nilsson's "The Point." What was supposed to be about a three month stay ended up lasting over 10 years! While in England, Micky directed such programs as "Fernwood Tonight" and "Luna," as well
							as co-creating, producing and directing London Weekend Television's award-winning series, "Metal Micky."</p>
						<p>In the early-80s, Micky kept busy by performing solo tours, including a successful run in Japan in 1980. In 1986, Monkee Mania II exploded and Micky toured the world for four years with band mates, Davy Jones & Peter Tork. By the end this extremely
							successful outing, Micky had moved back to the U.S. and was back on the road with solo concerts. In the early-90s, Micky was in the studio recording "Micky Dolenz Puts You To Sleep" and "Broadway Micky," both children's albums. September 1993 brought
							the release of Micky's autobiography, I'm A Believer: My Life of Monkees, Music, & Madness. Dolenz also provided background vocals on Peter Tork's 1994 solo album and joined the theatre production of "Grease." For 1994 and 1995, Micky toured the
							country with Davy Jones on their "Together Again" tour and made a guest appearance on the "Brady Bunch Movie." At this time, Micky showed a passion for painting and began taking it up himself. His first art show took place in 1995 in Philadelphia,
							PA. For most of 1996 and 1997, Micky participated in The Monkees 30th Anniversary reunion, before they went their separate ways. "Demoiselle," a collection of Dolenz demos spanning decades ago was released under his own label in 1998. In 1999,
							Micky replaced Davy Jones on the "Teen Idols Tour," which also featured Bobby Sherman and Peter Noone. In the late-90s, Micky appeared and directed on episodes of "Boy Meets World," and made guest spots on shows such as "Pacific Blue" and more
							recently, "The Drew Carey Show," "As The World Turns," and "General Hospital."</p>
						<p>After the turn of the century, Micky once again re-joined with The Monkees in 2001 and 2002. After announcing their engagement in late-2001, Micky married Donna Quinter in late-September 2002. In 2003, Micky went on the road with his band performing
							your favorite Monkees hits and rock n' roll classics. He also began touring the U.S. with the cast of "Aida" in the spring. Continuing his role as Zoser, Micky performed in "Aida" on Broadway until the fall of 2004. Right in the middle of his time
							on Broadway, in May 2004, an updated edition of his autobiography was released. On January 10, 2005, Micky started his new career as host of WCBS-FM 101.1's morning radio show in New York. Unfortunately, his new career was cut short that summer
							when the station went to its "JACK" format and laid off their line-up of DJs. He didn't stay inactive for long, though, and published his first children's book in May 2006, titled Gakky Two-Feet. At about the same time, Micky Dolenz' Rock 'n Rollin'
							Trivia: Put Your Knowledge of Pop Music Legend, Fact & Myth to the Test was released to the public, as well.

						About: Mike Nesmith
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>
							Robert Michael Nesmith was born on December 30, 1942 in Houston, TX. His mother, Bette invented liquid paper and would later leave the $20 million estate to him. Affectionately nicknamed "Nez," he learned to play saxophone as a young child and would join
							the United States Air Force years later. After two years in the Air Force, he left to pursue a career in folk music. In the mid-60s, he left home to move to Los Angeles, CA, with the intent of getting into the movie business. During this time he
							formed the duo, "Mike & John" and recorded several solo singles under the name "Michael Blessing."
						</p>
						<p>
							With hopes of getting a job as a songwriter, Mike auditioned for The Monkees in late-1965. While still a member of The Monkees, Mike's first solo album, "The Wichita Train Whistle Sings," was released in 1968 and reached No. 144 on Billboard's charts.
							Also in 1968, "Different Drum" a Nez written song, became a major hit for Linda Ronstadt and the Stone Poneys. By 1970, Mike had left The Monkees to form The First National Band, which would begin his successful solo career as the "Father of Country-Rock."
							Mike and The First National Band would sign to RCA Victor and release two albums in 1970, "Magnetic South" and "Loose Salute." Along with the albums, "Joanne" reached No. 6 on the Adult Contemporary charts and No. 21 on the Pop charts, and "Silver
							Moon" peaked at No. 7 on the Adult Contemporary charts and No. 42 on the Pop charts. In 1971, The Second National Band was formed to release "Nevada Fighter" that year and "Tantamount to Treason" in 1972. In 1972 the band separated and Nez was
							left to record "And the Hits Keep Comin.'" After 1973's "Pretty Much Your Standard Stash," Michael left RCA Victor to form Pacific Arts in 1974, after the failure of his "Countryside" label. In 1977, the hit single, "Rio," and its accompanying
							album "From a Radio Engine to a Photon Wing" were released as was Nez's TV chart show "Pop Clips." The show further developed Mike's idea of music videos, which was later bought from him by Warner who developed it into MTV. 1978 brought "Infinite
							Rider on the Big Dogma," which would turn out to be his last album for over a decade. While he held off on his music career, Mike produced short films for "Saturday Night Live" and "Fridays" in 1979.
						</p>
						<p>
							By the early-80s rolled around, Pacific Arts was one of the most successful companies in the country and Nez had won the first ever Grammy for "Best Music Video" in 1982, with "Elephant Parts." He even starred in his own comedy TV series called, "Michael
							Nesmith In Television Parts" that aired on NBC for eight episodes. After making two guest appearances with The Monkees in 1986 and 1989, he released his first album in over 10 years in 1992, titled, "...Tropical Campfires..." Nez supplied background
							vocals for Peter Tork's 1994 solo album as well as releasing his own solo album "The Garden," which was nominated for a Grammy Award in the new age category. For most of 1996 and early 1997, Mike participated in The Monkees' 30th Anniversary. During
							this time, he also formed a new company, Videoranch, which would be the home of his past and future projects. Nez showed he was a worth novelist in 1998 when his first novel, The Long Sandy Hair Of Neftoon Zamora, was released. He spent 1999 touring
							the country to promote the book, which would be released on audio CD in 2002. Also, near the turn of the century, Nez won over $47 million in a court case with PBS that had destroyed Pacific Arts.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now Nez is keeping busy re-issuing his solo material on compact disk and video through Videoranch. In 2006, he's trying to find a publisher for his already-finished second novel, The American Gene, and will release his new solo album "Rays," which could
							lead to a promotional tour.

						About: Peter Tork
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>Peter Halsten Thorkelson was born on February 13, 1942, in Washington D.C. He is the son of John and Virginia Thorkelson and sibling of a sister and two brothers. As a child, his family moved to Connecticut, where some of his family still lives
							today. Even as a young boy, Peter showed musical talent and could play the guitar and banjo. In the early 60s, he left home to join the Greenwich Village folk scene where he performed for a few years before making the big move to Los Angeles, CA
							in the mid-60s, when he changed his name to Tork.
						</p>In the fall of 1965, Peter's good friend, Stephen Stills, encouraged him to go audition for a new TV show about a Beatles-like band. Soon after, he was chosen to become a member of the TV and music smash, "The Monkees." Though The Monkees were
						still very popular, Tork left the group at the end of 1968 due to personal and professional reasons.
						<p>Not long after The Monkees, Peter formed the company, BRINCO (Breakthrough Influence Company) that would produce both movies and records. The company didn't last long and Tork's life had gone down hill after being caught with possession of drugs.
							Now a recovering alcoholic, Peter has been clean for over 20 years, which is an accomplishment he has become very proud of. In the early-70s, he played guitar for the group Osceola. Also during this time period, Peter became a social studies, math,
							and music teacher for a California high school for a year and a half, before returning to show biz. In 1976, Peter joined Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart onstage for a concert on their tour. Later that year, he, Dolenz, and Jones recorded a new Christmas
							single for that holiday season.
						</p>
						<p>In the early-80s, Tork formed a band called The New Monks and released a 45 single, "Peter's Back," containing "(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone" and "Higher & Higher." After The New Monks separated, he created The Peter Tork Project. But in 1986,
							his solo career was put on hold when The Monkees reunited for their 20th Anniversary. This successful reunion lasted until the end of 1989. Although Peter was the first to leave The Monkees originally, he never released a solo album until his self-produced
							1994 effort, "Stranger Things Have Happened." Also in 1994, Tork, Tadg Galleran, and Michael Sunday formed Shoe Suede Blues. Peter has performed with them on and off since the band's creation. 1995 saw Peter making a guest appearance on "The Brady
							Bunch Movie" as well as multiple guest spots in the TV show "Boy Meets World." In 1996, fans saw more new music from Peter, when he and good friend James Lee Stanley recorded "Two Man Band." For a good portion of that year and 1997, The Monkees
							had reunited again for their 30th Anniversary. In 1999, "Shoe Suede Blues Live" was released on the internet and at SSB concerts.In the early-80s, Tork formed a band called The New Monks and released a 45 single, "Peter's Back," containing "(I'm

							and at SSB concerts.
						</p>
						<p>More recently in 2001, Tork and James Lee Stanley collaborated on their second effort as a duo, with "Once Again" before Peter re-joined Micky Dolenz & Davy Jones for tours that took up most of 2001. Soon after, he went back to Shoe Suede Blues
							and in early 2002, the band released a follow-up to their debut album, called "Saved By The Blues." In 2019, at the age of 77, Peter Tork has become the second member of the band to whom we must bid farewell. Per The New York Times, Torkâ€™s death
							was confirmed by his son, Ivan Iannoli, who said the cause was complications of a rare form of cancer that was first diagnosed in 2009.
