						About: The Monkees
					</h1>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>In 1965, over 400 people responded to an ad seeking young men for a new television show about a rock group called The Monkees. The Monkees, starring Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork premiered on September 12, 1966, and audiences
							adored the humorous antics of the band. Though made for TV, The Monkees had real-life hits and struggled against their "Pre-Fab Four" image. Some of their best-loved and number one hits included Neil Diamond's "I'm a Believer" and "Last Train to
							Clarksville." More successful singles followed, including another Neil Diamond song, "Little Bit Me, Little Bit You," Gerry Goffin and Carole King's "Pleasant Valley Sunday", and "Daydream Believer" by John Stewart of the Kingston Trio.

						About: Davy Jones
					</h1>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>Davy Jones became a popular teen idol in the late 1960s. He began an acting career at the age of 11, winning a role on the popular British soap opera Coronation Street. Jones trained to become a jockey for a time, but gave up that career path to
							perform on stage. He played the Artful Dodger in a London production of the musical Oliver!, reprising the role for his Broadway debut in 1963. He received a Tony Award nomination for his performance that same year. Jones landed a few television
							guest appearances and other roles before landing his big break: Along with Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork and Mickey Dolenz, he was selected to perform on a new TV series about a rock group modeled after the Beatles. The Monkees debuted in September
							1966, with audiences adoring the humorous antics of the manufactured band. Jones especially attracted attention from fans due to his charm and boyish good looks.</p>

						About: Mickey Dolenz
					</h1>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>George Michael Dolenz was born on March 8, 1945 in Los Angeles, CA to George and Janelle Dolenz, who were both involved in show business. Nicknamed "Micky," he has three sisters including Coco, who frequently performs with him at his current solo
							shows. As he got older, Micky played with many nightclub bands including Micky and the One Nighters, where he played rhythm guitar and lead vocals. During this time period, Micky recorded his first single, "Huff Puff"/"Don't Do It." As it turned
							out, the single never saw the light of day until 1967, when "Don't Do It" reached No. 75 on the Billboard charts. In the fall of 1965, Micky was a college student studying Architecture when he auditioned for a part in "The Monkees." Just weeks
							later, he was chosen to become a member of the TV and music phenomenon. During this time, Micky got his first directing job on "The Monkees" TV show's "Frodis Caper" episode. By late-1970, the other Monkees had given up and Micky was left to pursue
							a solo career.</p>

						About: Mike Nesmith
					</h1>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>
							Robert Michael Nesmith was born on December 30, 1942 in Houston, TX. Affectionately nicknamed "Nez," he learned to play saxophone as a young child and would join the United States Air Force years later. After two years in the Air Force, he left to pursue
							a career in folk music. With hopes of getting a job as a songwriter, Mike auditioned for The Monkees in late-1965. While still a member of The Monkees, Mike's first solo album, "The Wichita Train Whistle Sings," was released in 1968 and reached
							No. 144 on Billboard's charts. After 1973's "Pretty Much Your Standard Stash," Michael left RCA Victor to form Pacific Arts in 1974, after the failure of his "Countryside" label.
						</p>
						<p>
							By the early-80s rolled around, Pacific Arts was one of the most successful companies in the country and Nez had won the first ever Grammy for "Best Music Video" in 1982, with "Elephant Parts." During this time, he also formed a new company, Videoranch,
							which would be the home of his past and future projects. Nez showed he was a worth novelist in 1998 when his first novel, The Long Sandy Hair Of Neftoon Zamora, was released. He spent 1999 touring the country to promote the book, which would be
							released on audio CD in 2002. Now Nez is keeping busy re-issuing his solo material on compact disk and video through Videoranch. In 2006, he's trying to find a publisher for his already-finished second novel, The American Gene, and will release
							his new solo album "Rays," which could lead to a promotional tour.

						About: Peter Tork
					</h1>
					<div class="col-12 content-text-about">
						<p>Peter Halsten Thorkelson was born on February 13, 1942, in Washington D.C. He is the son of John and Virginia Thorkelson and sibling of a sister and two brothers.Even as a young boy, Peter showed musical talent and could play the guitar and banjo.
							In the early 60s, he left home to join the Greenwich Village folk scene where he performed for a few years before making the big move to Los Angeles, CA in the mid-60s, when he changed his name to Tork.
						</p>
						<p>In the fall of 1965, Peter's good friend, Stephen Stills, encouraged him to go audition for a new TV show about a Beatles-like band. Soon after, he was chosen to become a member of the TV and music smash, "The Monkees." Though The Monkees were
						still very popular, Tork left the group at the end of 1968 due to personal and professional reasons. Not long after The Monkees, Peter formed the company, BRINCO (Breakthrough Influence Company) that would produce both movies and records. The company
						didn't last long and Tork's life had gone down hill after being caught with possession of drugs. Now a recovering alcoholic, Peter has been clean for over 20 years, which is an accomplishment he has become very proud of. Per The New York Times,
						Torkâ€™s death was confirmed by his son, Ivan Iannoli, who said the cause was complications of a rare form of cancer that was first diagnosed in 2009.
